# React Native useRef 'current' Property Unexpectedly Undefined

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React Native involving the `useRef` hook.  The problem arises when the `current` property of the ref unexpectedly remains undefined, even after the component has mounted. This often occurs in scenarios with complex component structures or animations.  The included example showcases the issue and provides a solution.

## Bug Description

The `useRef` hook in React Native is typically used to access DOM elements or manage mutable values within functional components.  However, under certain conditions, notably with complex component hierarchies or during animations, the `current` property might remain undefined, leading to errors or unexpected application behavior.

## Solution

The provided solution implements a safe access mechanism.  Instead of directly accessing `ref.current`, the solution introduces a check to ensure `ref.current` is defined before attempting to use it. This prevents errors and promotes smoother application operation.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application on your preferred React Native emulator or device.
4. Observe the console for errors or unexpected behavior.
